# Hill-Cipher-Enryption-and-Decryption-for-text
My 4th Sem Project on the Application of Linear Algebra in Hill Cipher Encryption and Decryption. This includes a C++ implementation of the Hill Cipher encryption and decrytion techniques for text strings which includes characters in the range 'a'-'z'. The key generator automatically analyzes the given input and creates a random key of optimum order which is further used to encrypt and decrypt text.
